# Exceptional Engineer Assignment 1: Calculate Correlation Between Data

## Requirements
The requirements of this assignment are:
1. Calculate the linear regression parameters `B0` and `B1`, and correlation coefficients `r` and `r^2` for a set of
   `n` pairs of data.
2. Given an estimated proxy size `E`, calculate an improved prediction `P`, where `P = B0 + B1 * E`

## Test Data
We have been supplied with the below minimum test data and the expected results with which to verify the correct
functioning of this program:

### Prediction Formula
Given an estimate `E` LOC for a program, we would estimate a value for `P` where: `P = B0 + B1 * E`.

## Results for Assignment 2
As shown by the Work Breakdown Structure below, I estimated that the project would take me a total of 2.7 hours, which
turned out to be a perfect estimate since it actually took me 2.7 hours.

The below "Plan vs Actual Time" graph and trendline show that the time I planned for each task listed in the above Work
Breakdown Structure is a tiny bit lower than the actual time I spent.

The below Project Rollup Plan Summary shows my productivity (in LOC/hour), the size of the program, and the defects I
both injected during development & removed.
