# Exceptional Engineer Assignment 1: Calculate an Earned Value Plan

## Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is to:
1. Dive deeply into how the Process Dashboard correctly calculates Earned Value for improved understanding
2. Understand my performance in developing a software product
3. Gather data on myself as I follow the Personal Software Process to develop software
4. Gain experience using the Process Dashboard

## Modules & Classes
- Program.cs: The unit test program that drives the main logic. It takes input Schedule and Task Plan data and outputs
  the Earned Value plans
- Validator.cs: Validates the input data
- Builder.cs: Builds the output data
- Models Directory: Contains the input and output models for Schedule and Task Plans
- Input Directory: Contains user-input Schedule and Task Plans, similar to the data a user would input into the Process
  Dashboard
- ExpectedOutput Directory: Contains expected output of the Schedule and Task Plans enriched with additional data. This
  is used for unit testing purposes, and only contains expected output for the sample data in the assignment due to
  time constraints.
- GeneratedOutput Directory: Contains the Schedule and Task Plans enriched with additional data generated by this
  program
- Images Directory: Contains images embedded in this README.md

## Software Design

### Phase 1: Deserialize the input JSON into internal model objects
